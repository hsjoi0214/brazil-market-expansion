# **Eniac Brazil Market Expansion**

## **Purpose**

### **Problem Statement:**
Eniac, a high-end tech product company, is expanding into the Brazilian market. A crucial part of this expansion is securing a reliable delivery partner capable of efficiently handling high-value tech products. The company has evaluated **Magist**, a Brazilian delivery company, and obtained its data for analysis.

### **Solution:**
A detailed analysis was conducted on **Magist’s** suitability as a logistics partner. This includes:
- **Customer review sentiment analysis** to understand user satisfaction.
- **Delivery time evaluation** to assess efficiency.
- **Performance comparison across different states.**

The findings help determine whether Magist meets the standards required for delivering Eniac’s products efficiently and reliably.





## **Summary**
This project evaluates **Magist**, a potential delivery partner for Eniac, through data analysis focusing on customer reviews, delivery efficiency, and state-wise performance. The goal is to ensure a reliable logistics network for high-value tech products in Brazil.
